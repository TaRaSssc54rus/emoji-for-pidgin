= Don't know how to install this pack?

Read http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/SmileyThemes

On Windows up until XP, ~ = C:\Documents and Settings\<your username>\
On Windows Vista and above, ~ = C:\Users\<your username>\

If you're reading this on GitHub, I highly suggest you use the download feature and get the .tar.gz or a .zip package, drop it in the necessary smiley directory, and extract it (preserve paths!) there. If you want to clone for usage, and not for Development, I suggest you git clone directly into the necessary smiley directory.

= Who made this?

Karl Fischer apparently made this pack originally and uploaded it to http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartySmileyThemes
I, Jason Salaz, took the pack, and added in the unicode characters as inserted when using the iPhone, making this pack exactly 19028509484% cooler. I left the meta-emoticon characters (e.g. :boy: :girl: etc.) in, so other people can still have a method of entering them in plainly without entering in a raw unicode code point.

= Why?

Because I'm a Mobile Zealot. And love Japanese things even though I don't understand the language.

= You screwed something up, you're an idiot!

Yeah, it happens. My method of putting this together was far from perfect. Come find me on the internet (Note: There is more than one Jason Salaz on the internet. Hint: http://github.com/VxJasonxV/ ), and report the bug. Or, in the true spirit of Open Source, Fork Me and fix it! (Pull Requests welcome!)

= Why aren't you using Markdown? Or Textile? Or reStructuredText?

Because Meta-Markup sucks. Thank you for asking.

= Why are you still adding to this README?
