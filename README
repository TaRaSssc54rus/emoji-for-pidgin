= Don't know how to install this pack?

Read http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/SmileyThemes

On Windows up until XP, ~ = C:\Documents and Settings\<your username>\
On Windows Vista and above, ~ = C:\Users\<your username>\

If you're reading this on GitHub, I highly suggest you use the download feature and get the .tar.gz or a .zip package, drop it in the necessary smiley directory, and extract it (preserve paths!) there. If you want to clone for usage, and not for Development, I suggest you git clone directly into the necessary smiley directory.

= Who made this?

* The images were apparently taken directly from the iPhone, which is exemplified by the fact that this emoji pack features two images of the iPhone, and is the exact contents of the Emoji 'keyboard' Input Method on the iPhone.
* The pack was originally designed as an "Adium Xtra" by Karl "Kalleboo" Baron ( http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=6224 ).
* The emoji pack was then ported to Pidgin by Karl "kmf" Fischer ( http://developer.pidgin.im/attachment/wiki/ThirdPartySmileyThemes/Emoji-for-Pidgin.tar.gz ).
* I, Jason Salaz, took the pack, and added in the raw unicode characters as inserted when using the iPhone, making this pack exactly 19028509484% cooler. I left the meta-emoticon characters (e.g. :boy: :girl: etc.) in, so other people can still have a method of entering them directly via any old keyboard, and not being forced to enter in a raw unicode code point.

= Why?

Because I'm a Mobile Zealot. And love Japanese things even though I don't understand the language.

= You screwed something up, you're an idiot!

Yeah, it happens. My method of putting this together was far from perfect. Come find me on the internet (Note: There is more than one Jason Salaz on the internet. Hint: http://github.com/VxJasonxV/ ), and report the bug. Or, in the true spirit of Open Source, Fork Me and fix it! (Pull Requests welcome!)

= Why aren't you using Markdown? Or Textile? Or reStructuredText?

Because Meta-Markup sucks. Thank you for asking.

= Why are you still adding to this README?
